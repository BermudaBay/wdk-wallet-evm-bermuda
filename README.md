**Note**: This package is currently in beta. Only supported network is Plasma testnet,

A simple and secure package to manage Bermuda accounts for EVM-compatible blockchains.

This package provides a clean API for both of
- creating Bermuda accounts from BIP-44 wallets, and performing deposits to, transfers within, and withdrawals from a Bermuda shielded pool

- creating, managing, and utlizing BIP-44 accounts à la [`@tetherto/wdk-wallet-evm`](https://github.com/tetherto/wdk-wallet-evm)

Since `WalletManagerBermuda` exposes the same `constructor`, `getAccount` and `getAccountByPath` interfaces as [`@tetherto/wdk-wallet-evm`](https://github.com/tetherto/wdk-wallet-evm) our **`wdk-wallet-bermuda` is a direct drop-in for [`@tetherto/wdk-wallet-evm`](https://github.com/tetherto/wdk-wallet-evm)**.

## 🔍 About WDK

This module is part of the [**WDK (Wallet Development Kit)**](https://wallet.tether.io/) project, which empowers developers to build secure, non-custodial wallets with unified blockchain access, stateless architecture, and complete user control.

For detailed documentation about the complete WDK ecosystem, visit [docs.wallet.tether.io](https://docs.wallet.tether.io).

## 🌟 Features

- **WDK-compatible wallet management**: Use the familiar `getAccount()` and `getAccountByPath()` APIs from `@tetherto/wdk-wallet-evm`
- **BIP-39 and BIP-44 account derivation**: Derive standard EVM accounts from a mnemonic seed
- **Deterministic Bermuda accounts**: Derive shielded accounts from an EVM account with `getBermudaAccount()`
- **Shielded deposits**: Deposit funds into the Bermuda shielded pool
- **Shielded transfers**: Transfer shielded balances between Bermuda accounts
- **Shielded withdrawals**: Withdraw shielded balances to a public EVM address
- **Shielded balance lookup**: Scan owned UTXOs and query balances for one or multiple tokens

## ⬇️ Installation

To install the `@bermuda/wdk-wallet-bermuda` package, follow these instructions:

You can install it using npm:

```bash
npm i bermudabay/wdk-wallet-bermuda
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Importing from `@bermuda/wdk-wallet-bermuda`

### Creating a New Wallet

```javascript
import WalletManagerBermuda, { WalletAccountBermuda } from '@bermuda/wdk-wallet-bermuda'

// Use a BIP-39 seed phrase (replace with your own secure phrase)
const seedPhrase = 'test only example nut use this real life secret phrase must random'

// Create wallet manager with provider config
const wallet = new WalletManagerBermuda(seedPhrase, {
  // Option 1: Using RPC URL
  provider: 'https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/your-api-key', // or any EVM RPC endpoint
  transferMaxFee: 100000000000000 // Optional: Maximum fee in wei
})

// OR

// Option 2: Using EIP-1193 provider (e.g., from browser wallet)
const wallet2 = new WalletManagerBermuda(seedPhrase, {
  provider: window.ethereum, // EIP-1193 provider
  transferMaxFee: 100000000000000 // Optional: Maximum fee in wei
})

// Get a full access Ethereum account
const ethereumWallet = await wallet.getAccount()

// Get the associated Bermuda account
const bermudaAccount = await wallet.getBermudaAccount()
```

### Managing Multiple Accounts

```javascript
import WalletManagerEvm from '@bermuda/wdk-wallet-bermuda'

// Assume wallet is already created
// The first parameter is the BIP-44 account index while the second is the Bermuda account index.
const account = await wallet.getBermudaAccount(0, 0)
const address = account.getAddress()
console.log('Account 0 address:', address)

const account1 = await wallet.getBermudaAccount(0, 1)
const address1 = account1.getAddress()
console.log('Account 1 address:', address1)

```

### Checking Balances

For accounts where you have the seed phrase and full access:

```javascript
// Get shielded ERC20 token balance
const token = '0x...'; // ERC20 contract address
const balance = await account.getTokenBalance(token);
console.log('Token balance:', balance);
```

### Deposit into Bermuda

```javascript
const txHash = await account.deposit({ token: '0x...', amount: 1n })

console.log('Transaction hash:', txHash)
```

### Transfer within Bermuda

```javascript
const txHash = await account.transfer({ token: '0x...', amount: 1n, to: '0x...' })

console.log('Transaction hash:', txHash)
```

### Withdraw from Bermuda

```javascript
const txHash = await account.withdraw({ token: '0x...', amount: 1n, to: '0x...' })

console.log('Transaction hash:', txHash)
```

## 🌐 Supported Networks

- **Plasma testnet**

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- **Seed Phrase Security**: Always store your seed phrase securely and never share it
- **Private Key Management**: The package handles private keys internally with memory safety features
- **Provider Security**: Use trusted RPC endpoints and consider running your own node for production
- **Transaction Validation**: Always validate transaction details before signing
- **Memory Cleanup**: Use the `dispose()` method to clear private keys from memory when done
- **Fee Limits**: Set `transferMaxFee` in config to prevent excessive transaction fees
- **Gas Estimation**: Always estimate gas before sending transactions
- **EIP-1559**: Consider using EIP-1559 fee model for better gas price estimation
- **Contract Interactions**: Verify contract addresses and token decimals before transfers

## 🛠️ Development

### Prerequisites

Development and testing require **Node.js >= 22** — a floor set by Hardhat, whose
`@nomicfoundation/edr` native bindings declare `engines: { node: ">= 22" }`. The recommended
version is pinned in [`.nvmrc`](.nvmrc) and the floor is enforced via `devEngines` in
`package.json`:

```bash
nvm use
```

> This floor applies to the **test toolchain only** — the published library itself supports
> older Node.js versions.

### Building

```bash
# Install dependencies (use `ci` to honour the lockfile exactly)
npm ci

# Build TypeScript definitions
npm run build:types

# Lint code
npm run lint

# Fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run every suite
npm test

# Run every suite with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run only the integration suites
npm run test:integration

# Run only the integration suites with coverage
npm run test:integration:coverage
```
