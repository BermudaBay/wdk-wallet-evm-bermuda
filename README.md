**Note**: This package is currently in beta. The only supported network is Plasma testnet.

A simple and secure package to manage Bermuda accounts for EVM-compatible blockchains.

This package extends [`@tetherto/wdk-wallet-evm`](https://github.com/tetherto/wdk-wallet-evm) with Bermuda shielded accounts. `WalletManagerBermuda` is a `WalletManagerEvm`, so it creates and manages BIP-44 accounts exactly like `@tetherto/wdk-wallet-evm` does, and adds `getBermudaAccount()` on top: Bermuda accounts derived from those BIP-44 accounts, which deposit to, transfer within, and withdraw from a Bermuda shielded pool.

## 🔍 About WDK

This module is part of the [**WDK (Wallet Development Kit)**](https://wallet.tether.io/) project, which empowers developers to build secure, non-custodial wallets with unified blockchain access, stateless architecture, and complete user control.

For detailed documentation about the complete WDK ecosystem, visit [docs.wallet.tether.io](https://docs.wallet.tether.io).

## 🌟 Features

- **Built on `@tetherto/wdk-wallet-evm`**: `WalletManagerBermuda` extends `WalletManagerEvm`, so `getAccount()`, `getAccountByPath()`, `getFeeRates()` and the provider options work exactly as they do there
- **BIP-39 and BIP-44 account derivation**: Derive standard EVM accounts from a mnemonic seed
- **Deterministic Bermuda accounts**: Derive shielded accounts from an EVM account with `getBermudaAccount()`
- **Shielded deposits**: Deposit funds into the Bermuda shielded pool
- **Shielded transfers**: Transfer shielded balances between Bermuda accounts
- **Shielded withdrawals**: Withdraw shielded balances to a public EVM address
- **Shielded balance lookup**: Scan owned UTXOs and query balances for one or multiple tokens

## ⬇️ Installation

To install the `@bermuda/wdk-wallet-evm-bermuda` package, follow these instructions:

You can install it using npm:

```bash
npm i bermudabay/wdk-wallet-evm-bermuda
```

The package is not on the npm registry yet, so it is installed from its GitHub repository (`bermudabay/wdk-wallet-evm-bermuda`) and imported as `@bermuda/wdk-wallet-evm-bermuda`.

npm 12 and later refuse git dependencies, such as this package, and URL dependencies, such as the Bermuda SDK it depends on, unless you allow them:

```bash
npm i bermudabay/wdk-wallet-evm-bermuda --allow-git=root --allow-remote=all
```

`allow-git=root` admits the git dependencies of your own project, which this package is one of. The SDK is a dependency of this package rather than of your project, so it needs `allow-remote=all`. Both settings can also go into your project's `.npmrc`.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Importing from `@bermuda/wdk-wallet-evm-bermuda`

### Creating a New Wallet

```javascript
import WalletManagerBermuda, { WalletAccountBermuda } from '@bermuda/wdk-wallet-evm-bermuda'

// Use a BIP-39 seed phrase (replace with your own secure phrase)
const seedPhrase = 'test only example nut use this real life secret phrase must random'

// Create wallet manager with provider config
const wallet = new WalletManagerBermuda(seedPhrase, {
  // Option 1: Using RPC URL
  provider: 'https://testnet-rpc.plasma.to', // Plasma testnet's public RPC endpoint, or any other one for Plasma testnet
  transactionMaxFee: 100000000000000, // Optional: maximum network fee (in wei) of EVM transactions, Bermuda deposits included
  transferMaxFee: 100000000000000 // Optional: maximum network fee (in wei) of EVM token transfers
})

// OR

// Option 2: Using EIP-1193 provider (e.g., from browser wallet)
const wallet2 = new WalletManagerBermuda(seedPhrase, {
  provider: window.ethereum, // EIP-1193 provider, connected to Plasma testnet (chain id 9746)
  transactionMaxFee: 100000000000000 // Optional: maximum network fee (in wei) of EVM transactions, Bermuda deposits included
})

// Get a full access Ethereum account
const ethereumWallet = await wallet.getAccount()

// Get the associated Bermuda account
const bermudaAccount = await wallet.getBermudaAccount()
```

### Managing Multiple Accounts

```javascript
import WalletManagerBermuda from '@bermuda/wdk-wallet-evm-bermuda'

// Assume wallet is already created
// The first parameter is the BIP-44 account index while the second is the Bermuda account index.
const account = await wallet.getBermudaAccount(0, 0)
const address = account.getAddress()
console.log('Account 0 address:', address)

const account1 = await wallet.getBermudaAccount(0, 1)
const address1 = account1.getAddress()
console.log('Account 1 address:', address1)

```

### Checking Balances

For accounts where you have the seed phrase and full access:

```javascript
// USDT0 on Plasma testnet (6 decimals)
const USDT0 = '0x502012b361AebCE43b26Ec812B74D9a51dB4D412'

// Get the shielded USDT0 balance (in base units)
const balance = await account.getTokenBalance(USDT0)
console.log('Shielded USDT0 balance:', balance)
```

### Deposit into Bermuda

USDT0 does not support EIP-2612 permits, so the Bermuda pool needs an allowance before a deposit: approve it with the master Ethereum account, and wait for the approval to be mined. The wrapped native token (WXPL) is approved automatically.

```javascript
const BERMUDA_POOL = '0xfa3193AD6DEEcaF7D5586d40808E80ad2Ca5A007' // Bermuda pool on Plasma testnet

const ethereumAccount = await wallet.getAccount(0)

const { hash } = await ethereumAccount.approve({ token: USDT0, spender: BERMUDA_POOL, amount: 1_000_000n })
await ethereumAccount.waitForTransaction(hash)

// Shield 1 USDT0 into the Bermuda account
const txHash = await account.deposit({ token: USDT0, amount: 1_000_000n })

console.log('Transaction hash:', txHash)
```

### Transfer within Bermuda

```javascript
// Send 1 shielded USDT0 to another Bermuda account, here the second one derived above
const txHash = await account.transfer({ token: USDT0, amount: 1_000_000n, to: account1.getAddress() })

console.log('Transaction hash:', txHash)
```

### Withdraw from Bermuda

```javascript
// Unshield 1 USDT0 to a public address (defaults to the master Ethereum account's address)
const txHash = await account.withdraw({ token: USDT0, amount: 1_000_000n, to: '0x...' })

console.log('Transaction hash:', txHash)
```

## 💸 Fees

`transactionMaxFee` and `transferMaxFee` (both in wei) are enforced by the underlying `@tetherto/wdk-wallet-evm` accounts, so they only cap the network fees the wallet pays itself:

| Operation | Fees | Capped by |
|-----------|------|-----------|
| EVM `sendTransaction()` | Network fee | `transactionMaxFee` |
| EVM `transfer()` | Network fee | `transferMaxFee` |
| Bermuda `deposit()` | Network fee of the deposit, and of the approval sent first for the wrapped native token | `transactionMaxFee` |
| | Protocol deposit fee, if the pool charges one, in the deposited token | Not capped |
| Bermuda `transfer()` | Relay fee, only if `options.relayFee` is set, in the transferred token | Not capped |
| Bermuda `withdraw()` | Protocol withdrawal fee and, if `options.relayFee` is set, relay fee, in the withdrawn token | Not capped |

Shielded transfers and withdrawals are submitted by a relayer, so **neither cap applies to them**: their fees are paid out of the shielded balance, in the token being moved. No relay fee is charged unless you set `relayFee` (together with `relayer`) in their options, so the relay fee is always the one you chose.

## 🌐 Supported Networks

| Network | Chain ID | Public RPC | USDT0 | Bermuda pool |
|---------|----------|------------|-------|--------------|
| Plasma testnet | 9746 | `https://testnet-rpc.plasma.to` | `0x502012b361AebCE43b26Ec812B74D9a51dB4D412` | `0xfa3193AD6DEEcaF7D5586d40808E80ad2Ca5A007` |

## 🖥️ Supported Runtimes

The package runs on Node.js and on [Bare](https://github.com/holepunchto/bare). Under Bare it is loaded through its `bare` entry point, `bare.js`, which sets up Bare's Node.js compatibility layer (`bare-node-runtime`) and fills the gaps that the Bermuda SDK's zero-knowledge prover, `@aztec/bb.js`, runs into on top of it:

- `@aztec/bb.js` imports `finished` from `stream/promises` and `threadId` from `worker_threads`, which `bare-node-runtime` does not provide. The modules in [`bare/`](bare/) add them.
- Two globals are patched, for the whole process. `TextDecoder` also accepts the labels of the `windows-1252` encoding, such as `ascii`, which `@aztec/bb.js` decodes the prover's output with. `WebAssembly.compile()` and `WebAssembly.instantiate()` keep Bare's event loop alive until they settle: Bare would otherwise exit while the prover is still being compiled.

Tested with Bare 1.34.0 on macOS (arm64) and, in CI, on Linux (x64):

- `npm run test:bare` loads the package under Node.js and Bare, from the checkout and from the packed tarball, derives EVM and Bermuda accounts against pinned vectors, and starts the prover.
- The integration suite deposits, transfers and withdraws from a Bare process, with real proofs, against a fork of Plasma testnet (`tests/integration/bare.test.js`).

Under Bare, keep in mind:

- Proofs come from the WebAssembly backend of `@aztec/bb.js`, on a single thread, where Node.js uses the native one. On an Apple silicon Mac, a deposit took 13 seconds and a transfer or withdrawal 11, against roughly 10 on Node.js.
- On first use, the prover downloads its CRS (about 38 MB, 105 MB once unpacked) into `~/.bb-crs`, or into the directory set in `CRS_PATH`.
- Import `@bermuda/wdk-wallet-evm-bermuda` before anything else that loads `@bermuda/sdk` or `@aztec/bb.js`. Bare caches each module with the import map it was first loaded with, so modules loaded earlier would miss the fixes above.
- WDK worklet bundles are not supported yet. A bundle builds, but fails to load: the Bermuda SDK loads its prover's dependencies up front, and those read their WebAssembly modules from disk as they load, which a bundle does not allow.

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- **Seed Phrase Security**: Always store your seed phrase securely and never share it
- **Private Key Management**: The package handles private keys internally with memory safety features
- **Provider Security**: Use trusted RPC endpoints and consider running your own node for production
- **Transaction Validation**: Always validate transaction details before signing
- **Memory Cleanup**: Use the `dispose()` method to clear private keys from memory when done
- **Fee Limits**: Set `transactionMaxFee` and `transferMaxFee` to cap the network fees of EVM transactions (Bermuda deposits included) and EVM token transfers. They do not cap the fees of shielded transfers and withdrawals; see [Fees](#-fees)
- **Gas Estimation**: Always estimate gas before sending transactions
- **EIP-1559**: Consider using EIP-1559 fee model for better gas price estimation
- **Contract Interactions**: Verify contract addresses and token decimals before transfers

## 🛠️ Development

### Prerequisites

Development and testing require **Node.js >= 22** — a floor set by Hardhat, whose
`@nomicfoundation/edr` native bindings declare `engines: { node: ">= 22" }`. The recommended
version is pinned in [`.nvmrc`](.nvmrc) and the floor is enforced via `devEngines` in
`package.json`:

```bash
nvm use
```

> This floor applies to the **test toolchain only** — the published library itself supports
> older Node.js versions.

### Building

```bash
# Install dependencies (use `ci` to honour the lockfile exactly)
npm ci

# Build TypeScript definitions
npm run build:types

# Lint code
npm run lint

# Fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run every suite
npm test

# Run every suite with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run only the integration suites
npm run test:integration

# Run only the integration suites with coverage
npm run test:integration:coverage

# Load the package under Node.js and Bare, from the checkout and packed
npm run test:bare
```

The integration suites include `tests/integration/bare.test.js`, which runs shielded operations under Bare.
